# Project Information

## Spam Classification
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify messages as spam or not spam. The key components include:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Import and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and noise.
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units (tokens).
  - Removal of unnecessary characters, stopwords, and punctuation.
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Utilizing techniques like **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer** to convert text into numerical representations.
- **Model Training:**
  - Training classification models such as **Naive Bayes** or **Logistic Regression**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Assessing model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets, focusing on the following steps:

- **Data Import and Preprocessing:**
  - Loading Twitter datasets and cleaning the data.
  - Handling special cases such as hashtags, mentions, and URLs.
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Removing noise and converting text to lowercase.
  - Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization for meaningful text extraction.
- **Sentiment Classification:**
  - Using machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest** to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Visualization:**
  - Generating plots and **word clouds** to visualize sentiment distribution and key terms.

These implementations demonstrate practical applications of **NLP** and **text classification** techniques in real-world scenarios.
