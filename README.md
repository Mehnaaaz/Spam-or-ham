 
# Spam Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on spam classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can effectively classify messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam) based on textual data.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Count Vectorization
- Model training with different classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Testing with new input messages

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

```sh
jupyter notebook Spam Classification.ipynb
```

Alternatively, if a script is available:

```sh
python spam_classifier.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled SMS messages. If not provided, you can use the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** available on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Model Training
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Convert text data into numerical features.
3. Train multiple classification models and compare their performance.
4. Save the best-performing model for future inference.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

These metrics help determine how well the model classifies spam and ham messages.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based NLP models (e.g., LSTMs, Transformers)
- Improve text preprocessing techniques
- Deploy as a web application or API
