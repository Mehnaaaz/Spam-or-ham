# Spam Classification

Spam Classification is a machine learning project aimed at distinguishing spam messages from legitimate (ham) messages. It involves text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming or lemmatization to clean and normalize the data. The text data is then transformed into numerical representations using methods like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or Count Vectorization, allowing machine learning models to process and classify the messages effectively. Several classification algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate and efficient model. The goal is to develop a robust spam detection system that can be integrated into messaging applications, email services, or online platforms to filter out unwanted content. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are applied to enhance model performance, ensuring reliable predictions on unseen data.

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled SMS messages, typically sourced from open datasets such as the SMS Spam Collection Dataset available on Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The trained model is assessed using classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate its effectiveness in real-world applications. The project can be executed using Jupyter Notebook or a Python script, making it accessible for both research and production use. Future enhancements include incorporating deep learning-based NLP models such as LSTMs and Transformers to improve classification accuracy. Additionally, deploying the model as a web-based API or integrating it into mobile applications could provide real-time spam detection capabilities, making it a valuable tool for businesses and individuals dealing with large volumes of digital communication.
